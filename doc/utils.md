================================

The following command-line utilities are provided with `libo3d3xx`:

1. o3d3xx-config
2. o3d3xx-dump

4. o3d3xx-reboot
5. o3d3xx-reset
6. o3d3xx-rm
7. o3d3xx-version

All of the command-line utilites accept the `--help` and the `--version`
flags. `--help` will list the arguments accepted by the program and `--version`
will display the version of `libo3d3xx` that the program is linked to.

A brief description of each program now follows:

o3d3xx-config
-------------

This program is used to configure all of the camera settings including device,
network, application, and imager configuration. In addition, this program can
serve as a means to restore the camera from a backup JSON file that conforms to
the file structure generated by `o3d3xx-dump`.

To perform a full restore from a file, assuming you have the backup in
`/tmp/camera.json` you can run:

	$ o3d3xx-config < /tmp/camera.json

OR

	$ o3d3xx-config --file /tmp/camera.json

If you just want to mutate a single setting, for example changing the active
application to the application located at index 1, you can:

	$ echo '{"o3d3xx":{"Device":{"ActiveApplication":"1"}}}' | o3d3xx-config

The JSON syntax is available as an example in this [camera.json](./camera.json).
